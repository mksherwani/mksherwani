    <p class="fs-5">
      This project focuses on integrating advanced imaging technologies with artificial intelligence 
      for faster, more accurate diagnosis. In modern radiotherapy, achieving precision is everything.
      While Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging offers outstanding contrast for accurately contouring tumors and organs at risk,
      it lacks the physical data required for precise radiation dose calculations. 
      Computed Tomography (CT), on the other hand, is necessary for those calculations but struggles with soft tissue contrast. 
      This gap inspired a growing field focused on generating synthetic CT (sCT) images directly from MR scans.

    <p class="fs-5">
      In this project, I applied my expertise in deep learning to develop and evaluate advanced methods for MR-to-CT translation,
      a process that could ultimately lead to MR-only radiotherapy workflows, eliminating the need for additional CT scans and reducing 
      patients’ exposure to ionizing radiation.

      My research was conducted using a dataset of paired brain MR/CT volumes.  
      Apart of image synthesis, I also conducted a thorough comparison of three loss strategies: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), 
      MAE combined with Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and MAE combined with Perceptual Loss.

      This work not only highlights my hands-on experience with deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and loss function engineering,
      but also my commitment to creating efficient, clinically viable solutions that advance personalized care.
      
      My vision is to empower medical professionals with tools that assist, not replace — improving 
      outcomes while reducing manual errors. Future iterations aim to integrate real-time feedback and cloud-based systems.
