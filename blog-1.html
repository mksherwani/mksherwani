    <h1>Revolutionizing Medical Imaging with Diffusion Models</h1>
  </section>

  <!-- Main content -->
  <div class="container">
    <p>Imagine a world where noisy, low‑dose CT scans become crystal clear. Where rapid MRI scans rival their slower, high‑resolution counterparts. That’s not science fiction—it’s happening right now thanks to diffusion models, a breakthrough in AI that’s poised to reshape medical imaging.</p>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>In this post:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>What diffusion models are</li>
        <li>Why they beat older AI methods</li>
        <li>Real‑world use cases you can try</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Why Should You Care?</h2>
    <p>Standard AI methods like GANs often struggle with stability—tiny tweaks can make them “hallucinate” unrealistic features. Diffusion models, by contrast, start from random noise and learn to clean it up step by step. The result? Images that look—and feel—more authentic, reducing diagnostic errors.</p>

    <h2>How It Works, Simply</h2>
    <p>Think of it as reversing a blur process:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Add noise:</strong> Gradually corrupt a clear image until it’s nearly random.</li>
      <li><strong>Learn to denoise:</strong> Train the AI to undo each noise step.</li>
      <li><strong>Generate:</strong> Start with random noise and run the denoiser backward to create a brand‑new image.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Top 3 Cool Applications</h2>
    <h3>1. Low‑Dose CT Reconstruction</h3>
    <p>Patients get less radiation, but doctors still see full‑detail images—no compromises.</p>

    <h3>2. MRI Speed‑Ups</h3>
    <p>Scan time can drop by half, making MRI more patient‑friendly and lowering costs.</p>

    <h3>3. PET Denoising</h3>
    <p>Sharper PET scans mean better tumor detection, even with minimal tracer doses.</p>

    <h2>A Quick Code Teaser</h2>
    <pre><code>from diffusers import DDPMPipeline
import torch

pipe = DDPMPipeline.from_pretrained("facebook/ddpm-medical-ct")
noise = torch.randn((1,1,256,256))
with torch.no_grad():
    slice = pipe(noise).images[0]
slice.save("diffusion_ct.png")</code></pre>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>From real‑time scans powered by specialized chips to federated models trained across hospitals, diffusion‑based imaging is just warming up. The next five years could see AI‑driven scanners that learn from every patient—and share insights securely, globally.</p>
