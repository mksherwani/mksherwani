  <p class="fs-5">
    This project tackles a critical challenge in modern medical imaging: segmenting infected lung regions 
    in CT scans without relying on annotated data. Traditional supervised learning methods require extensive, 
    expert-labeled datasets — a costly and time-consuming process, especially during global health emergencies.
  </p>
  <p class="fs-5">
    Our approach leverages <b>CycleGAN</b>, a type of generative adversarial network, to transform infected lung images into their 
    healthy counterparts. The difference between these two representations provides a highly accurate segmentation map 
    — all without a single labeled sample. 
  </p>
  <p class="fs-5">
    We further refined our results using <b>attention-guided masks</b>, allowing the model to focus solely on the infected regions 
    while preserving healthy tissue. This innovation significantly boosts segmentation quality and opens the door for real-world deployment.

  <h2 class="mb-4">Impact & Vision</h2>
  <p class="fs-5">
    My contribution to this project reflects deep expertise in Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based architectures and unsupervised learning strategies. 
    By circumventing the need for annotated data, this method offers scalable solutions during crisis periods like pandemics, 
    where speed and accuracy are vital.
  </p>
  <p class="fs-5">
    This research reported competitive metrics across multiple evaluation benchmarks — including Dice Score and Structural Similarity — 
    outperforming several state-of-the-art unsupervised models. Beyond COVID-19, the proposed framework can be generalized 
    to other lesion detection problems across medical imaging modalities.
  </p>
  <p class="fs-5">
    My long-term vision is to create AI systems that <b>augment radiologists</b>, not replace them — systems that can detect, highlight, 
    and adapt in real-time to clinical feedback. With future iterations, we aim to integrate this model into cloud platforms for 
    real-time diagnosis, supporting global healthcare infrastructures with low-resource access.
